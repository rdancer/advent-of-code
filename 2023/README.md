Each day is in its separate directory.

Each day has a separate `Makefile`. You must log into your [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com)
account, download the input data, and save it as `input.txt`. Running `make` in
the day's directory will create `solution1.txt` and `solution2.txt` containing
the solution.
